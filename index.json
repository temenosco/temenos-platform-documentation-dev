    "title": "Architecture Overview",
    "keywords": "Architecture Overview Where does Temenos Development Platform fit into the enterprise IT landscape? The Temenos Development Platform promotes the concept of simplified and standardised change promotion through the IT landscape. Typical organisations have a number of non-production (i.e. development/test) environments, where changes are implemented and checked prior to deployment to production systems. The Devops movement seeks to improve this QA process through means of automation, which both allows an increase in speed in change promotion, and a reduction in the risk of manual errors when promoting changes. The Development Platform includes a simple and repeatable method of collating changes (both configuration and customisation) which subsequently is simple to promote from environment to environment. In addition, the core function of the Development Platform is to simplify the environment provisioning process, which means if extra stages in the change flow are required (e.g. for additional testing phases), it becomes far simpler to spin up temporary environments for these purposes. It should be noted that the Development platfrom only supplies non-production environments (also known as 'sandboxes'), which means organisations will still require at least one non-production environment on representative hardware in order to sanity check changes prior to production release (see example below). Delegating platform and infrastructure responsibilities to a third party allows organisations to concentrate on what is important to them - applications and data. The Development platform may be used for simple environment provisioning, or may be augmented by additional tools (such as Continuous Integration tooling) to provide a streamlined and automated development experience. The change promotion mechansim within the Development platform is simple to plug into standard CI tooling to push code/config/data from environment to environment. An example development flow is shown below: What are the components of Temenos Development Platform? Development & Testing environments are managed by the Development Portal, and are comprised of distinct components as described below: Component Description Portal The Portal is the front-end component of the Development Platform which allows users to perform management functions across development environments. These functions include user management and environment provisioning/scaling. Configuration Repository The Configuration Repository is the 'change hub' for the Development Platform. It supports configuration and customisation (per environment), including T24 updates, custom config/code packages, database imports and third party plug-ins/add-ons. T24 Instance The T24 instance comprises the application and database for T24. The application tier may be scaled horizontally as required (via the management facility in the Portal). Exports (File Storage) The T24 database may be exported via the management facility in the Portal, as may the 'environment' (file system level). These exports are stored per environment and may be downloaded by users via SFTP. What can you do with Temenos Development Platform? Below is a list of functions which can be performed using Temenos Development Platform. Function Description Provision a new environment Create an environment Scale an environment Scale a environment horizontally by adding/removing additional T24 instances for a given database instance Delete a environment Delete a environment Manage a user Create/ edit/ delete a user Apply configuration/ customisation Apply the necessary change components to create a customised environment configuration for an organisation Login to T24 Use the resultant customised environment Import a database Import a database into a environment Export a database Export a database from a environment (e.g. to re-import into another environment) Export an environment Export a copy of a environment (file system level) for offline perusal What tools do I need to use Temenos Development Platform? Below is a list of tools which may be used to exploit Temenos Development Platform functionality. Tool Description and Rationale Git Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. A client program for Git is required to push artefacts into the configuration repository. SFTP Client SFTP is the protocol used to download file exports (environment or database exports) Continuous Integration Tool (Optional) Continuous Integration tools may be used to help automate change promotion between environments. There is no CI tool provided as part of the Temenos Development Platform, but these are useful in reducing manual tasks when managing environments. Design Studio (Optional) Design Studio is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) produced by Temenos for developing changes in T24 systems. Design Studio itself does not form part of the Development Platform, but change outputs from this tool are supported within the Configuration Repository."

    "keywords": "What is Temenos Cloud Continuous Deployment? Temenos Development Platform is a product within the Temenos Cloud Platform suite, and is cloud based infrastructure for use during development, test, implementation, and ongoing change with configurable and scalable Temenos Suites on-demand, unless otherwise stated. The Development Platform enables you to create Environments, i.e. Temenos Suites on-demand, for non-production use in the cloud. Environments can be requested and provisioned within minutes rather than weeks helping you accelerate your projects. Retail Suite is readily available, with all other Temenos Suites (Corporate, Wealth, Micro-Finance and Islamic Banking) available on request and allows you to develop and test your proof of concept, share development environments across dispersed teams, replicate production environments or use them for training. The speed, reliability, and agility of these environments will instantly add value to your implementation and scale your project delivery capacity. What is Temenos Continuous Deployment? Temenos Continuous Deployment is an offering from Temenos Cloud that provides client individuals and teams with the ability to manage, configure and assemble client licensed Temenos Software – either fully deployed and supported by Temenos Cloud or utilising the client’s own cloud infrastructure. The Temenos Cloud Offering Temenos Continuous Deployment What is the “Assemble” service pack of the Temenos Continuous Deployment? “Assemble” service pack provides a DevOps solution to perform continuous integration and delivery of Temenos Products and customisation, thereby enabling faster time to market for features. The Assemble service pack of Temenos Continuous Deployment is used during the continuous integration (“CI”) and continuous delivery (“CD”) of Temenos solutions. The Assemble service pack can accelerate the pace of change and increase confidence in the software deliveries by managing the Assemble of Components (updates, main release, and Level 3 developments), the provisioning into testing Environments, the execution of tests scripts, and providing detailed dashboards of the results. This Assemble service pack further allows the Client to configure Products and Releases which match their own specific needs. The main objective being to streamline ongoing change and accelerate implementation / upgrade projects. Features Self-service environment provisioning An authenticated user, e.g. a developer or tester, has the ability to request an environment from the catalogue of templates ; this template will be materialised into compute, storage, and networks on the Temenos Cloud. See architecture . The administrator, e.g. the project manager, is in control of number of the users and maximum number of running environments, thus having total control of the platform and its usage. Secure configuration and environment management A developer, is able to configure a personal SSH Key on their user profile and use this key to securely push changes over SSH. Deployment of change into the environment is fully automated for configuration, updates, plugins, add-ons and data. These changes can be stored in a software configuration management repository and deployed to the environment via a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment process. Controlling the environment A user is able to scale up, scale down, start, stop, delete, and export data from an environment. Furthermore, a user is able to push a database into the configuration repository and rebuild the environment, thereby refreshing the database back to that point in time and re-apply transactions and configuration as required. As an example, a developer or a tester can load a database and collaborate to validate changes and test cases in a shared environment. Should these users need to delete or migrate an environment, they can export the data, create a fresh environment with the latest release, upload the data and continue working all managed through the portal. When development activity requires additional resources, the users can easily scale up the environments and equally reduce capacity or stop it entirely. Monitoring the environment A user can export the application log data, monitor the status of the environments (started, starting, stopped, stopping, rebuilding), and see the results of any application deployments. Controlling the application The Temenos core banking template exposes endpoints for the user interface and TAFJEE management screens that allows a user to control COB job services. Managed Resources Users Each user has their own profile within an Organisation. Please check here more details about Users. Environments An environment is an instance of an application and the platform provides the facilities to manage the application configuration. Organisations The users of the platform can provision and manage the environments within their Organisation. Please check here for more details about Temenos Cloud management of Organisations and Environments. Templates Environments can be provisioned using a variety of pre-defined application, processing, storage, network, and operating system configurations. Please check here for more details. Data and Security Considerations The Temenos Development Platform is for non-production use only , unless otherwise stated. No 'personal data'; 'confidential' or 'sensitive' data should be stored on any Environment. • Data is stored in UK datacentres • Data is encrypted in transit • Access to management facilities requires username/password and/or SSH certificates • Environments can be deleted immediately by the user. All client-related data will be deleted by Temenos 60 days after the termination of the agreement"

This is used by the system and prevents users from editing the key itself. But allows edit of the value if “editable” is set to true. Editable – Specifies if the key-value pair is editable. Keys with editable false are always created by the internal system and users cannot edit such records Deletable – Specifies if a record can be deleted by a user.

    "keywords": "Stage API/UI – Feature Description A Stage is a logical name for a promotional stage. Every component/module developed by an organization needs to go through several steps to be declared ready for deployment to product. These steps are exactly what we call stages. Each stage has the following fields: Name: A simple name for the stage Note The name can only be set on creation time and it cannot be updated . Description: A simple description to be helpful to users. Enabled/ Disabled Flag: A stage can be enabled or disabled at any time provided there are no Factories associated to it. When a new stage is created, an isolated folder is created in the Artifactory Server to enable the binary/ installable components to be uploaded. When the components work well with other components/modules, the component is promoted to other stages, as defined by factories. The promotion of the components across stages is conditional based on the status of tests that are done during a factory run. If the tests succeed, the components will be promoted to the next stage. How to Set Up/ Edit/ Delete Stages Set-up/ Create a Stage Login to the Temenos Continuous Deployment Platform. Click on Settings button on the left menu > this will expand a menu containing buttons for: Streams, Stages, Products, Factory and General. Click on Stage button, make sure you select the Stream where you want to add a stage and then on the New Stage on the top right. Fill the name (mandatory field) . Take into account these conditions (also notified on the screen): Name can start only with a letter or an underscore and it can contain only letters, digits, underscores or hyphens. Fill the description (mandatory field) . Check the Enable option and then click Create . Note : Instead of choosing the enable option, you can create a disabled stage and enable it later, but the default option should be enable. Edit a Stage Compared to the streams, a stage can have only the description edited/ changed, but not the name. Why? Because when creating a stage, a folder is created automatically in the Artifactory containing the stage name. This folder will contain the components that you may be added for the respective stage. Just click the edit button, change the description and then click update. Delete a Stage Note The default stable_dev stage cannot be deleted. Example: Suppose we have created a stage named Primary_stage. No matter if we have configured further components and products, we can just go and delete this stage. Any other created stage can be deleted at any moment as it is not dependent of the subsequent features added such as components and products. Components and Products belong to the streams."

For example a bank that is running T24 can choose to make a new enhancement to the T24 installation. All efforts to develop, test and release this enhancement can be collectively called a stream . It represents a group dedicated to a specific development feature (or other logical grouping to represent a new feature implementation etc.) that may consist of the following resources: People – Developers, testers, business managers and other people involved in developing new features for the bank. Code and other digital resources – Code specific to the features, Binaries, VMs, Test Scripts etc. Processes – Each team works with a different workflow and may have variations in the processes. Each stream requires an isolated setup of resources to keep their work separate from other streams. For example, each stream will have a separate folder (or repository) for all of their digital resources and can possibly implement a customized workflow for their development promotion. Each stream has other inherent components for it to be useful. The parts of the stream are listed below: Stages Components Products Factories Factory Run Environments These components, together, act as an isolated group of elements for each Stream and help an organization create and manage efforts of a group. An organization can create as many streams as needed. Each stream is just a logical name for the grouping and has nothing more than a “Name” and a “Description”.

After the successful creation, your stream will appear on the screen (in case you already have other streams, the newly created will be the last in chronological order) and it will automatically have associated the default stage named 'Stable_Dev'. Edit a Stream You can edit anytime the name, the description of the stage or choose the disable option by clicking the edit button. Delete a Stream Note In order to delete a stream, you need to delete first all the subsequent features created. See example and explanations below. Example 1: Suppose we have created a stream named Dev2 that has just the default stage (stable_dev) and without adding other stages or configuring further components and products. We can just go and delete this stream (even if it has the stable_dev associated to it). Example 2: Suppose we have created a stream named Dev that has the default stage (stable_dev) and and also a stage named Primary_stage, without configuring further components and products. In order to be able to delete a stream that has more than the stable_dev stage , we need first to go and delete the stages attached to it. Go first to Stages button on the left menu > Select first your stream (top right) > Select the stage that you want to delete (others then stable_dev - because this stage cannot be deleted ) > And click the delete button. Go back to Streams and you will notice that your stream has only the stable_dev stage associated, therefore you are able to delete the stream. Click the Delete button. If you have added other stages and also components and products, first delete all the products, then the components, then the associated stages and finally you will be able to delete the stream.

    "keywords": "Introduction This user guide shows different ways of accessing details related to your development environment when deploying the following: Design Studio Packages Plugins Updates WAR files 1. Export Environment Details The Export Environment Details functionality gives you access to different information related to your sandbox like: -> the T24 UD (default) folder from your T24 sandbox -> the jars deployed in your T24 sandbox -> the war files deployed(with success or not) in your T24 sandbox -> the jboss server.log from your T24 sandbox. The environment details are exported in a SFTP server to which you have to connect in order to download the related files in your local machine. For this purpose, make sure you download and install WinSCP SFTP client. The Export Environment Details functionality can be triggered from PaaS Portal following the bellow steps: Log-in to your organisation in PaaS Portal, go to your enviroment page and click on the Export Environment button for the T24 application. After click, the Export Environment button will become disabled(as per bellow picture), meaning that the export was triggered. Note The Export Environment action is finished when the Export Environment button becomes enabled. In order to download the exported files of your environment from the SFTP server to your local machine: In PaaS Portal for your organisation, go to your environment page and Right click and copy the sftp.temenos.cloud Endpoint or click the copy to clipboard icon from the right: Open WinSCP SFTP client and create a new site that will allow you to connect to the SFTP server. Make sure you put sftp.temenos.cloud Endpoint as Host name, your PaaS user as User name and instead of password, the SSH key related to your PaaS user must be used. In order to attach the SSH key, press Advanced button, go to Authentification menu and select the private key related to your PaaS user. After attaching your SSH key, save your site with any name for future use. Click Login to connect to the SFTP server. If connection is successful, you will have 2 sections in WinSCP: -> the left section(highlighted in black) represents the location from your local machine where the environment details will be downloaded. -> the right section(highlighted in yellow) represents the location of the exported environment details in the SFTP server; the environment details are saved in the SFTP server in /organisationID/environmentID folder structure. Go inside your environmentID folder and you will see a zip file that contains the Environment Details. In order to download the zip, select it and press F5. After downloading the zip file to your local machine, unzip it and you will have the bellow folder structure: Based on the above folder structure, you can check the following: -> If you deployed any update in your sandbox, check if jar/jars related to the update are changed in the jar list from modules/com/temenos/t24/main folder. -> If you deployed any package in your sandbox, check if the jar related to the package is present in modules/com/temenos/t24/main/localjars folder. -> If you deployed any war file in your sandbox, check if the war was deployed with success(a file named war_name.deployed should be present in standalone\\deployments folder). The war deployment will be failed if a file named war_name.failed is present in standalone\\deployments folder and this file must be checked for details. 2. TAFJEE Monitoring Tool TAFJEE Monitoring Tool can be used in the following situations: -> To get the TAFJ installation details from your Environment (using tDiag Servlet) -> To get the compilation details for a T24 routine from your Environment (using tShow Servlet) -> To access various logs from your Environment like Database log or Runtime log (using Logger Servlet) -> To access como content from your Environment (using Como Servlet) -> To execute DBTools commands (using DBTools Servlet). To access the TAFJE Monitoring Tool for your Environment, log-in to your organisation in PaaS Portal, go to your enviroment page and click on the MONITOR APPLICATION Endpoint for the T24 application. The bellow page is opened from which various servlets can be accessed.

Note: UTP is the Unified Temenos Platform, an exclusively internal Temenos program and an umbrella term for work related to improving the way we develop, build, test and release software. The TCD solution is composed of the Extend and Assemble modules to enable the provision of development and Integration test environments. The current state allows for these two modules only. Roadmap features envisage a Deliver module to cover pre-production and production environments. The TCD Extend module is a multi-tenanted provisioning and deployment module that provides Users and/ or other systems with self-service management of Environments and provides access to the tools for enhancing Client Licensed Temenos Software. The Extend module enables authorised Users to provision Environments from a list of Templates for non-production use during development, test, integration, implementation and ongoing changes to the Products. The Extend module is a cloud-hosted platform service and manages Environments in either the Temenos cloud or a Client’s Target Cloud account. Each Environment is a standalone instance of one or more Products or approved third-party applications / products running on the middleware defined in the Template. Each Factory is formed of an Environment and one or more Test Clients. The Test Clients have their own Templates, which define their infrastructure, software Components and configuration. The TCD Assemble module performs the test pipeline automation, continuous integration (“CI”) and continuous delivery (“CD”) of Client’s changes to Client’s Licensed Temenos Software. The Assemble Module utilises the same technologies as the Extend module, and does: deploy Test Clients; execute the Clients’ tests; orchestrate the deployment of Environments with Factories and the promotion of Packages through a workflow; manage storage of test results and application logs; manage the lifecycle of test Environments; provide a dashboard of test results with links to the underlying manifests, templates and, where appropriate, running Environments. The TCD test result dashboard is a multi-tenanted web application hosted and operated by Temenos. The dashboard shows historic test results for a Factory within a configured Release and trends through a web UI pulling data from the Assemble Modules local database and test results and application logs in Target Cloud storage. The TCD Artefact Repository is a third-party artefact repository “Artifactory by Jfrog” . The repository holds all the built software Components that are referenced by the Templates at the relevant test and deploy Stages. The Client will push all of its Product packages to the Artefact Repository"

The clients will be supplied with a URL and initial login, from there they will be able to create their own environments at their chosen release, add users for a developer or team of developers and then they can create the environments immediately. The users can create up to the maximum number of environments purchased, once the environment is destroyed, another individual or team can create a new environment up to the maximum. Thus many users can share a single subscription, removing collaboration barriers accross the project team while supporting automated testing. Who will handle customers’ queries/issues for Development Platform? Sales queries will be handled via the Temenos Cloud (CloudPlatformSupport@temenos.com) support team.

Note This guide presumes that an Environment is already created and available. (In this example, we have created a Environment named DevEnv). Three properties are mandatory to create a new endpoint: Property Name Property Description Endpoint Description The Endpoint Description will be displayed in your Organisation Portal in the Endpoints section of the T24 application from your Environment. Endpoint URL The Endpoint URL will be: * opened in a new tab of your browser when the Endpoint Description is clicked, if the Endpoint type is clickable. * copied , if the Endpoint type is copyable. * downloaded , if the Endpoint type is a downloadable. Endpoint Type In order to apply above actions, a type must be defined for each endpoint, based on how you want to be used: clickable, copyable or downloadable. Note The URL must be of type: \"https://........\" . As a reference, if you want to insert an endpoint which links to your environment browser web, please check the related URL - for example: https://t24-xxxxxxxxxxxx.temenos.cloud/BrowserWeb/ ) In order to create new endpoints for the T24 application of your Environment, the next steps must be followed: Clone the GitLab repository of your Environment in your local machine. For more details on how to clone a repository, check this page . Create a file with .endpoint extension inside plugins folder of the cloned repository as in the bellow picture. The name of the file is not important, but it should be relevant for your requirement. Inside the .endpoint file, add a new line for each endpoint with the structure Your_Endpoint_Description~Your_Endpoint_URL~Your_Endpoint_Type , as per bellow picture: Note \" ~ \" character is used as a separator between Endpoint Description, URL and Type and it must always be present in each endpoint line. Endpoint Description and URL are as per your choice. Type must be one of the options: clickable , copyable or downloadable . After creating and editing the .endpoint file, commit the file to the GitLab repository of your Environment. (In this example we have used TortoiseGit to commit and push the endpoint file - Command: Git Commit ->\"master\") Go to your environment to the portal and click the deploy button under the Repository. Wait until the .endpoint file is deployed in your Environment and check the Endpoints section of the T24 application as below: Add multiple endpoints from a single file If a plugin has more than one endpoint, create a .endpoint file and add a separate line for each endpoint item, as below: After the file is deployed, all 3 endpoints from the example are displayed in the Endpoints section of the T24 application. Also note that the endpoints are displayed/ grouped by their type: clickable, copyable and downloadable. Add multiple endpoints from multiple files at the same time If you want to add endpoints for multiple plugins deployed in your Environment, you can add the endpoints of all plugins in a single file or you can also create a separate .endpoint file for each plugin for a better delimitation. After both files are deployed, the three endpoints for plugin1 and the two endpoints for plugin2 are displayed in the Endpoints section of the T24 application. Update/Remove endpoints If you want to update endpoints that were already added to an application, you just have to update the required endpoint line from the .endpoint file, commit the file to the GitLab repository of your Environment and after the file is deployed, the required endpoint will be updated in the Endpoints section of your Application. If you want to remove endpoints that were already added to an application, you just have to remove the required endpoint line from the .endpoint file, commit the file to the GitLab repository of your Environment and after the file is deployed, only the endpoints available in the .endpoint file will be displayed in the Endpoints section of your Application. Also, to remove all the endpoints from a .endpoint file do not remove/ delete the file , but remove all the endpoints lines inside the file (empty the file). Note To summarize, the list of plugin endpoints displayed in the Endpoints section for an application is updated based on the content of .endpoint files available in the plugins folder from the GitLab repository of your Environment. If no .endpoint files are available in the GitLab repository of your Environment, then no plugin endpoints will be displayed."

Click on Settings button on the left menu > this will expand a menu containing buttons for: Streams, Stages, Products, Factory and General. Before creating a component, make sure you select first the stream (top-right) where you want to add the respective component. Click on Products button. (This button includes creation of the components and then Click on the New Component on the top right. Select the Component Type from the dropdown list (the list displays all the components available for your Organization. This is based on the available templates). Input a Name. Take into account these conditions (also notified on the screen): Name can start only with a letter or an underscore and it can contain only letters, digits, underscores or hyphens. Fill the Description. Fill the Display Name. Click Create . See below example: After creating it, under Component Details you will notice a link of this type: Upload URL: http://platformdevartifactory.dev.temenos.cloud:8081/artifactory/stable_dev/Dev/Stable_Dev/T24_Browse A folder is automatically created into the repository (we are using JFrog Artifactory) with the name of your component and will be always created under the default stable_dev stage. This is the path where the components' files should be uploaded as explained on the next steps: (Please note that the components' artifacts can be uploaded any time before running a factory). (If the related artifacts are not uploaded, running the factory will not be possible and an error message will be thrown). Select single or multi depending on the number of archives you need to add, drag and drop or select the archive and then click deploy . You will see a success message and the archive under your component. Note Components artifacts are delivered to clients by Temenos Distribution team. Also the binaries/ artifacts have to be uploaded each time a component is updated. Which Components to Add In order to know which are the minimum required components that you need to add, you must first check the Templates Catalog (see button on the left menu). From here, select the template that you want to use: Make sure you select first the Template Type (FCM, T24, Tools, Wealth etc.). Then from the available Templates Catalog, select the one that you need in order to check the components. Under Full Template Content, scroll until you see the components section. Note: Usually there are at least two components sections: one related to T24 and another one refers to Model Bank Database (or other db). Depending on the template type, there could be more components, so please make sure you scroll down to check entirely the template in order to add all required components. Is is required to add at least all the mandatory components. In addition to the mandatory components, you will need to add those components you need to test - not related to your selected template. For all added components, make sure you add the related files archive into the artifactory as explained above. Delete a Component Components fields are not editable, so you have only the options to create or to delete them. Note If your component is attached to a Product , you will not be able to delete it. You need first to delete the product, then return to the component and click Delete button. Products – Feature Description A product is a logical grouping of several components. This is just to make it easy for users to select a list of components to deploy instead of selecting each component in a sequence. A product has the following fields (all mandatory) : Name Description List of constituent components - at least one component is required Ultimately, a product is used in a factory and will be used eventually to deploy the required components. How to Set Up/ Edit/ Delete Products Set-up/ Create a Product If you have created more streams, first make sure you select the stream where you want to create the respective product (see top right). Click on Products tab and then on New Product button on the top right. Input a name, description and select the mandatory components from dropdown button. This should represent the Principle Product (or one of the principle products) you will use when creating a factory. Click Create button. See also below example. For components, the selection order is not important. In addition to the principle product which has all template mandatory components, you will need to create other products - Base Products - that will be used to be tested. Edit a Product You can edit: The product description. The components field by adding or removing components. Just click the edit button, do the changes and then click update. Delete a Product Go to the Products tab and select the product you want to delete. Click the delete button. Note If the respective product is attached to a factory, you will not be able to delete.

    "keywords": "Templates Customization Introduction This document can be used by technical staff who need to customize already defined PaaS templates based on specific requirements. Templates customization will allow changes related to: the environment applications (i.e. the scripts to install and configure each application and the information displayed in PaaS Portal for each application); the VM specifications in which each application is deployed. Note This guide presumes that a environment is already created and available under an Organisation for which the templates customization functionality is allowed. Boost your environment To start customizing your environment built using a Temenos Cloud template, login to Temenos Continuous Deployment platform using your organisation user, go to your environment page and click on the Boost button attached to Repository application. After clicking the Boost button, the status of Repository application is changed to Boosting , as per bellow picture. The operation triggered by the Boost button will copy in environment repository all the template files used to create the environment. Repository structure after Boost As stated above, the Boost operation will make changes to environment repository. The difference between the before and after boost environment repository versions is represented by the presence of environments folder, as it can be observed bellow. The structure of the environments folder is represented by 3 folders: infra-templates playbooks roles The description of each folder is presented bellow: Folder Name Folder Description infra-templates This folder contains an infratemplate.yml file that describes the template of your environment (i.e. information related to the applications that are installed in your environment and VM specifications in which environment applications are deployed.). playbooks This folder contains a playbook.yml file that describes the set of roles that will be installed for each host(VM) defined under [services][servers] component in infratemplate.yml file. roles This folder contains all the roles defined for your template. A role represents any of your environment applications or it can be a module/plugin/framework that is required for your environment applications. A role is described by the following folders: defaults - contains default variables for the role. files - contains the files which are deployed using this role. handlers - contains handlers that are used by this role. meta - defines meta data for this role. tasks - contains the list of tasks that is executed for this role. templates - contains templates that can be deployed using this role. vars - contains the role variables. Note A role definition must include at least one of the above folders. Thus, any unused folders can be excluded. However, any in use folder must include a main.yml file that contains the relevant information. Note Ansible automation tool is used by the PaaS Platform to automate environment creation based on applications with specific requirements and installation steps. For more details about Ansible, please access this link . Start template customization After boosting your environment, meaning that your environment repository contains all the folders and files related to your environment template, you can start the customization. There are several ways in which you can customize your environment template based on the type of your change. Note All the changes that must be implemented to a PaaS environment template can be done only in environment repository . Thus, environment repository must be cloned in your local machine. For more information about how to clone an environment repository, please check this page . Changes that will require the rebuild of your environment : Note The rebuild operation will take around 20 minutes and it will recreate all environment resources (VMs) and run the deployment of all roles defined in environment template. To trigger the rebuild of your environment, login to PaaS portal using your organisation user, go to your environment page and click on the Rebuild button attached to your environment main application. Changes related to applications that will be installed under your environment. The applications list is defined in [services][servers] component from infratemplate.yml file located in /environments/common/infra-templates folder of environment repository. An example of a template with 2 applications (t24 & h2) is presented bellow. -> If an application must be removed from the default application list of the template, then the corespondent item must be removed from [services][servers] component and the item related to the application must be removed from playbook.yml file from /environments/common/playbooks folder. -> If an application must be added to the default application list of the template, then a new item must be added in [services][servers] component. After this, a new role must be created for this application in /environments/common/roles folder of environment repository and playbook.yml file from /environments/common/playbooks must be updated with a new item for the new application. Changes related to applications information (name, description, etc.) displayed in PaaS Portal. Each environment application has a related item in [services][servers] component from infratemplate.yml file. Please check the description of each key (e.g. app_name , app_description , etc.) in infratemplate.yml file in order to understand which information appear in PaaS Portal. Changes related to VM specifications in which environment applications are deployed. The VM specifications on which each environment application is deployed are defined in [provider][azure][config] component from infratemplate.yml file. [server_size] key defines the VM specifications that will be applied for all applications defined in [services][servers] component. If different VM specifications must be applied to each environment application, then [server_size] key must be set in [services][servers] component for each application. The detailed VM specifications can be viewed here . Note After making the required changes, commit and push them to your environment repository and trigger the rebuild. To make sure there are no syntax erros in the updated infratemplate.yml file, you can use this online validator . Changes that will require the deployment of your environment : Note The deployment operation will take around 5 minutes or more depending on your changes. To trigger the deployment of your environment, login to PaaS portal using your organisation user, go to your environment page and click on the Deploy button attached to Repository application. Changes related to roles already present in template. (i.e. an environment is already created with this template) If an already present role must be updated (for example, the tasks list for a role must be updated), make the required changes for that role, commit and push the changes to the environment repository and trigger the deployment. Changes related to roles tha represent a module/plugin/framework and not an application. New roles that represent a module/plugin/framework and not an application can be added to an application of your environment. In order to accomplish this, a new role along its settings must be created in /environments/common/roles folder and the new role must be added to the specific application in playbook.yml file from /environments/common/playbooks folder. After this, push all these changes to environment repository and trigger the deployment. Changes that are not related to environment template. For the changes described here that are not related to environment template, you just have to commit and push the required changes to your environment repository and trigger the deployment. Note If the deployment operation is not successful for your changes, please rebuild the environment.

Starting an environment: After creating an environment, the Start button is automatically disabled as the environment is running. It will be enabled if an environment is stopped and it will start all the instances specified in the Environment configuration. Stopping an environment: Stops all running instances of an Application in an Environment. Rebuilding an environment: It recreates the resourses into the cloud and re-installs T24 and H2 db. This is used for example when modifying the application templates (like changing the T24 displayed name or addign a new application). Deleting and environment: Stops all instances of an Application in the Environment, removes all resources including configuration repository. Scaling up and down an environment: Increases, respectively decreases the running instances of the Application) – via the UI. Exporting an environment and exporting the database: Allows to export and import an environment or a database through SFTP server. Boosting Used to apply the changes made to the environments' repository (you can modify the infra-templates, the playbooks or the roles). Deploying To be used when deploying newly added plugins, endpoints, updates, web services, packages etc. Cloning an environment: Creates an identical environment by copying the Environment and configuration repository Note IMPORTANT! As a good practice and in terms of reducing your costs, it is recommended that you don't keep an environment unused for more than 3 days (for internal clients), respectively for more than 7 days (for external clients). Otherwise, the environment will be deleted by the Extend team (with a previous mail notification). Also to reduce costs, the environment can be put on Stop ."

Login to your organization on the TCD (Temenos Continuous Deployment) portal ( https://portal.temenos.cloud/ ), ( https://tcd-portal.temenos.cloud/ ) read and accept the privacy notice. Create an Environment Once logged, go to the Environments tab on the left and then click New environment button on the right. Fill Name and Description fields. Select T24 from Cloud Native Applications (dropdown list). And then choose a T24 template with the version that you need (in current example R18.11). Labels field is optional . Click Create button. Wait about 15-20 minutes to see the action completed and to have your environment available. Note To see how to create an environment, please also check this user guide. Note For this user guide, there are two environments created: DevEnv DevEnv1 They will be used to see how to export the DB from one environment and import it into the other one. Add a User to the Portal Go to Users tab and click New user Fill all required fields Make sure you attach an SSH key to the user created, as it is required when exporting and importing the database. Note This user can be used on both environments (DevEnv and DevEnv1). Check this user guide to see how to create a user on the portal and attach a SSH key. Change a record into the Database (for demo purposes) Note This section is just an example and it can be skipped. The only purpose is to prove that the export and import of the database has been done correctly by showing that a changed record from a source environment can be retrieved in another environment (where the source environment database has been imported). Go to your environment Connect to T24 browser (Click Go to Application ) And login to T24 with your user and password: (Please note that first login will be slower) Amend a customer record Go to User Menu > Customer > Amend Customer In the new screen, type a customer number from your db (ex. 190094) and click Find Then click amend button Change the GB Town/City from the Physical Address tab and then press Commit the deal button in order to save the change. ( Note : You can do any change on any record type) Two notifications about Customer's documents will pop up > Mark them as ' Received ' and Click \" Accept Overrides \" > Transaction is complete The next step is to authorize the record change: Log out and login with a different user (in production, this user will have special rights) Go to User Menu > Customer > click Authorise/ Delete Customer menu Click authorise button ( double-check ) > The screen is expanded with the details of the customer > Click again authorise Export the Database In case you want to export and re-import the database into an environment or do some changes and import it back or to a different environment, please follow the steps below: To trigger the export, click the Export button under Database (also confirm the action on the pop-up to be able to proceed). After clicking, it will start exporting (the action should take less than a minute or more minutes based on the DB size). While exporting, the button is disabled, after the export is done, the button gets enabled back. Note Please note that the same steps showed in this demo can be followed to export an environment. Start exporting by using the Export button (check the available buttons under T24 Release). During this action, the db is exported through SFTP server to which you have to connect in order to download the related content on your local machine. Download WinSCP from here . Open WinSCP and create a new site which will allow the connection through SFTP server: For host name, use the endpoint of the db. (You can copy it from your portal by clicking the copy icon near the endpoint of the database - 'sftp.temenos.cloud'). For the user name, put the PaaS user name that you have created on the portal. (Check Users tab to see the available users). Instead of password, click Advanced A new screen is open Choose SSH > Authentication > and browse for the private key related to your portal user > click OK. After attaching the SSH key, click on save button – here we can give a site name that we want for future use. Previous screen will appear - click login to connect to the SFTP server. It will search for host and connect to it. A successful connection will display two sides as follows: On the left side - the location from your local machine where the db will be downloaded. On the right side - the location of the exported db on the SFTP server; the DB is saved in the folder with the organization id and environment id ( /organisationID/environmentID folder structure ). The database appears as TAFJDB.zip. In order to download the zip, select it and press F5. After is being downloaded, you can unzip it to see the db file. After this step, you can close the SFTP connection: Session > Disconnect. Clone the Target Environment For each Environment there is a Repository associated to it. This repository needs to be cloned locally and then the database will be pushed into it. Next step is to deploy it to the Temenos Cloud target environment (DevEnv1 in current example). To be able to clone, you need to have a GUI Git Client installed on your local machine. Example: Tortoise Git Also, during cloning, it will be necessary to attach the private ssh key related to your portal user. (If needed, please check this user guide). Login to your environment on the portal, locate the endpoint of the repository and copy it by selecting it OR clicking the icon on the right. Create a folder on your computer (you can place it anywhere on your local machine). In this example is named 'GitDemo' Click right inside the folder and choose Git Clone (this command belongs to TortoiseGit) In the screen that opens, fill the following: in the URL textbox, paste the Endpoint of Repository Application of your Environment (previously copied) the Directory textbox to your local repository folder should be automatically determined as current folder location load the private key (this is the private key corresponding to the public key of your portal user) click OK The content is downloaded from the repository of your environment to your computer, displaying a success message if the cloning was correct. You will be able to see the corebanking repository structure with several folders like: addons, client_files, packages, plugins, updates, wsdl etc. The TAFJDB.zip must be placed into client_files > h2db folder: Note In case you made changes to the db file, please make sure you archive it as a ZIP and rename it as TAFJDB - capital letters are case sensitive - before pushing it into the repository). Also note that this procedure will replace the existing database in the cloud with this one. The old database will be lost, including any records loaded manually. Commit and Push the DB Click right inside the h2db folder and choose Git commit master , check the not versioned files that you want to push (in this case TAFJDB.zip), put a comment in the box, then commit and push. After the success message, close the box. Deploy DB and Check the Change Go back to the portal to the target environment and click the Deploy button under the Repository After the deployment is done, you can check the change of the database as follows: Click Go to Application to open a T24 Browser Login with your T24 user and password Under User Menu, go to Customer > Individual Customer > More Actions > Search Live File (from dropdown arrow) and click Go The searched record is displayed > Click on the search/selection button on the left > The GB Town Country line should be changed into Portland confirming the correct import of the database"

    "title": "Factories",
    "keywords": "Factories Factories are the core Assemble components that define how, what and when to deploy, test and promote the various components used by an organization. A factory is an information bundle that holds the following critical information that is needed to run an assembly factory: Name Used just to identify or tag a factory Products a. Principle Products – Principle products simply mean the list of components that are being tested against a stable set of other pre-tested components. After successfully running the factory, the principle products are promoted to the next stage (the configured one). b. Other products (Base Products) – Products that are pre-tested (by other factories) and are known to be stage. These are products that don’t need to be promoted but they are required to test the Principle Products. Stages a. From stage (Which stage to get the principle components from) – Source stage (The stage from which pre-tested stable components can be picked up). b. Source Stage – The stage from which the “Other Products” (Base Products) components are fetched. This stage represents a stable version of components that is pre-tested from the perspective of the current factory. c. Target Stage - The stage to which components are promoted if the assembly successfully tests the list of components Templates a. Environment Template - holds the details of the template that is to be used to deploy the components selected by the factory b. Test Template – specifies the template that is required to deploy a test environment that holds the testing framework and test scripts. This is needed to generalize the test tools as a template. WebHooks a. Success Webhook – This is just a simple callback mechanism that can be utilized by the owner of a factory to callback another API if the factory successfully runs. b. Failure Webhook – Same as Success Webhooks. But are called when the factory fails. Validations The list of selected products cannot contain components that are not understood by the selected Environment Template. a. The list of components contained in the principle and other products needs to match a bare minimum of all mandatory components specified in the template. b. The list of components can possibly have more than one component of the same type if the template allows more than one count of the same type. c. The list of components cannot contain a component type that is unknown to the Template. Webhooks – The webhooks need to be valid URLs and can only get called with GET method. Templates – The selection of templates are restricted based on the type of the template and a selection list is already confined to allocated and valid templates. Stages – No restriction. The factory can even choose to use the same Stage for all three stage values. Note See below configurations to understand better how to configure correctly and the factory's behavior. How to Set-up/ Edit/ Delete Factories Set-up/ Create a Factory Click on Settings button on the main menu on the left. Make sure you select first the Stream and Stage where you want to create a factory and then click New Factory button on the top-right. Fill the required fields (see all definitions above and also below example). All fields are mandatory except the last three (Base Products, Success Webhook and Failure Webhook) . Name: choose a meaningful name for your factory. Description: put a description that will help knowing what the factory is about. Templates: choose an Environment Template from the dropdown list. Based on this template will be created the environments where you will be able to test different products. Test Environment Template: this is a defaulted test tool available on the Platform in order to be able to run your tests on the Platform interface. Based on the Environment release you should choose the related Test Template. Source Stage: this is the stage with the stable version of components. Base Stage (target stage) : this is the stage where components are promoted. When testing the first time, you can choose the same stage for source and base to make sure everything is promoted successfully. Principle Products - these are promoted to the next stage and belong under Source Stage. Base Products - these are products that don’t need to be promoted but they are required to test the Principle Products and they belong under the Base Stage. Click Create button > the factory is successfully created. Edit a Factory Click the Edit button. Any field can be changed/ edited as long as the entire Factory configuration complies with the validation rules. Click the Update button. Delete a Factory You can easily delete a factory by clicking the delete button. The products, stages and streams created before can be re-used."

'Build pipeline' builds the artifacts and deploys them in test environment. Once the testing is successful and it's ready for promotion, 'Promote pipeline' deploys the tested artifacts into integrated dev environment. For this tutorial, we will be integrating Jenkins with GitHub so that Jenkins can pull the code and build artifacts. To implement the Pipeline as a code we will use Jenkins Pipeline in order to automate tasks associated with building, testing and deploying software. Access Development Portal Sign into one of the following URLs (choose the link you have been provided with): portal.temenos.cloud or https://tcd-portal.temenos.cloud/ using the credentials provided by Temenos (Username and Password): Create a new environment Fill the required fileds and press Create Note You will need to create following three environments: • A build environment with template \"Build resources\" • A source environment with the required template ( in our example is \"Retail Suite R18.11\" ) • A target environment with the same template as the last one Build resources environment: Click New Environment button and fill the mandatory fields as in below picture: Fill the following parameters and press 'Create environment' : • Name • Description • Template • Labels (optional) Note It might take about 15-20 minutes to create the enviroment. Login to Jenkins After the \"BuildResources\" environment has been created, click on it and go to Jenkins Dashboard: In the new screen, click Login button on the top-right corner: Sign in with user admin and password changeit Note After first login, you will need to change the password. Change the password Click on 'Admin' button on top-right corner and then, on the left side, click on 'Configure' button Input a new password, confirm it, click 'Apply' and then 'Save' Note In case of a coffee break during the Jenkins configuration, the session may expire. Make sure when you come back that you are still logged or login again. Build pipeline workflow Build Pipeline works based on pipeline script (Jenkins file). Requirements: It requires valid credentials to pull the code from your Git repository (Github/Gitlab..etc). Users need to add credentials to clone the git repositories. For setting up credentials please refer to below section \"Add SSH keys inside Jenkins\" Steps during build: Pulls the code from GIT Builds the artifacts using DS binaries Deploys the artifacts in the TEST environments Generate SSH key This section explains how to add the credentials in order to clone the Git repositories. The Jenkins Server requires a Source code repository, which will be taken from Github repository (or another kind of repository that you have), then a Development environment and a Test environment. The dependencies between all of them are done through the ssh keys. The SSH key is used to authenticate between the Jenkins server and the environments. The keys solve different problems such as: user identification, security/ privacy and continuos integration and delivery best practices First, you will need a SSH key, which can be generated by using PuTTY: As instructed on PuTTY screen, move the mouse over the blank area to generate the key. PRIVATE KEY After the key is generated, go to Conversions tab and choose Export OpenSSH key (force new file format) PUBLIC KEY Click on Save private key button Later during Jenkins configurations, it will be necessary to use these SSH keys. To use the public key, you need to click right on the key saved (.ppk format) and select Edit with PuTTYgen Add user to the portal Go to portal.temenos.cloud , respectively https://tcd-portal.temenos.cloud/ . Click on New user And fill the required fields Note Copy-paste the entire public key generated before and then delete the last part until equal sign and press Create user Add a second user to the portal The same as for the first user added, first make sure you generated a new SSH key and then: Go to portal.temenos.cloud , respectively https://tcd-portal.temenos.cloud/ . Click on New user And fill the required fields Note Copy-paste the entire public key generated before and then delete the last part until equal sign and press Create Add SSH key to GitLab repository We are using GitLab repository, but you can use a different one. In this repository you have to add the ssh keys for the users created in order to connect to Jenkins and build resources. The users created into the https://portal.temenos.cloud/ will be automatically added in the Gitlab repo. Log in to GitLab as an admin and follow below steps: Click on the key for admin area Go to users tab Search the users created ( example: cristina ) and press enter Click on the user name and then on the edit button on the right Set a password of minimum 8 chars and repeat password for confirmation, then Save changes Logout from admin menu and login with the new user and the password set before Change user password: Once you login, you will notice that it will be required automatically to setup a new password (Input your current password > Set a new password > Confirm it > Click Set new password After this step you will be automatically logged out and you need to login again with the new password Click on the user icon on the top-right corner and select 'Settings' Go to SSH Keys tab and paste the public key that you generated before as follows: paste the entire public key > you will notice that the Title field is automatically completed with the last part of the key ( rsa-key-20180731 ) delete the last part until equal sign and press Add key Repeat the same steps from this section ('Add SSH key to GitLab repository') for the second portal user that you created.
