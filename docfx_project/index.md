The Extend module of the Temenos Cloud Factory is used by the ‘change the bank’ teams for self-service management of Environments and provides access to the tools for enhancing Temenos solutions.  The Extend module is an online software portal, which enables authorised Extends to provision Environments from a list of Templates.  These Environments are for non-production use during development, test, integration, implementation, phases and ongoing changes to the Products.  Self service provisioning of Environments, within minutes rather than weeks, can help accelerate development and ongoing change.  Temenos is able to create production like Templates for any of the Temenos Product Suites (Retail, Corporate, Wealth, Micro-Finance, and Islamic Banking).  These production like Environments enable the Client to develop and test more realistically at proof of concept, demonstrate more representative enhancements across their teams, and perform more life-like scenarios within training.  The speed, reliability, and agility of these Environments will instantly add value to Client’s implementation of Temenos Products and scale your project delivery capacity.

The Assemble module of the Temenos Cloud Factory is used during the continuous integration (“CI”) and continuous delivery (“CD”) of Temenos solutions.  The Assemble module can accelerate the pace of change and increase confidence in the software deliveries by managing the Assemble of Components (updates, main release, Level 3 developments), the provisioning into testing Environments, the execution of tests scripts, and providing detailed dashboards of the results. This Assemble module further allows the Client to configure Products and Releases which match their own specific needs.  The main objective being to streamline ongoing change and accelerate implementation / upgrade projects.
