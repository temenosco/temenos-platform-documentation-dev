# Develop T24 Packages, Plugins and Code

## Introduction & Prerequisites

This developer guide presents the required configurations and the main steps for the following actions:
 - develop new/existent jBC routines and deploy them to your sandbox
 - import/export applications/enquiries/versions from/to your sandbox to/from your local machine
 - extract from the database/load in the database data (.d) files from/to your sandbox to/from your local machine.
 
For this purpose, you need to have access to:
 - Design Studio (locally)
 - T24 libraries (locally)
 - TAFJ (locally)
 - Temenos Sandbox (cloud)
 - Tortoise Git (locally)  - download from <a href="https://tortoisegit.org/download/ "Tortoise"" target="_blank">**here**</a>.

 
A development package (containing Design Studio, T24 libraries and TAFJ) is provided by Temenos  and it is pre-configured in order to be able to introspect T24 application hosted in Temenos Could Development Platform.

This package is adapted according to the T24 version of your sandbox and it is provided as a **.zip** file. 

After extracting it in your local machine to any location, the bellow folders should be available:

- DS
- t24Lib
- TAFJ


To be able to interrogate the sandbox database, following update must be applied to **tafj.properties** file from Your_DEV_Path\TAFJ\conf:  

temn.tafj.jdbc.url=jdbc:h2:tcp://**ENV_DNS**:9092/TAFJDB;MODE=Oracle;TRACE_LEVEL_FILE=0;
TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=0;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;
FILE_LOCK=NO;IFEXISTS=TRUE;CACHE_SIZE=131072;
MVCC=TRUE;LOCK_TIMEOUT=30000   
 <span style="color:red">Replace **ENV_DNS** with **your environment DNS**.</span>

 
## Create New Project in Design Studio 
In order to accomplish the development actions presented at the beginning of the guide, you need to create a new project in Design Studio.

* Start Design Studio from _DesignStudio_ folder using **StartDesignStudio.bat** file and choose the default workspace (Your_DEV_Path\DesignStudio\workspace) or any other workspace from your local machine.
* After Design Studio starts, go to **File** > **New** > **Project**.  
* Select **Design Studio Template Project** from **Design Studio** item and click **Next**.  
![design studio template project](./images/ds-template-project.png)

<br>
* In the next screen, select **t24-packager-tafj** template from the drop down list and set **tafjHome**, **insertDir** and **libDir** parameters according to Your_DEV_Path.  

> [!Note]
> <span style="color:RED">**VERY IMPORTANT!**</span>
> 
> <span style="color:RED">Make sure you set the following values as per below instructions, otherwise the package installation will fail:</span>
> 
>  - project-name - always use small letters as per this standard: xx-name (in current example we used: **ft-sample**)
> 
>  - release - use the T24 release (example R17, R18, R19 etc.)
> 
>  - product-name: use ony two capital letters. **Note** that it must correspond to your project name: 
>   - Example: if project-name is xx-name, the product-name must be XX 
>   - Example: if project-name is ft-sample, the product-name must be FT 


> - component name - must be the same as in project name, after the "-". Must start with capital letter.
>   - Example: if project-name is xx-name, the component-name must be Name 
>   - Example: if project-name is ft-sample, the component-name must be Sample 


> - version: make sure you input the correct version (example 18.11)
>
> - host - login to the portal, go to your Environment > Go to Application > Select the address of your T24 environment (example: https://t24-1abbbbbccc900.temenos.cloud)

## Data (.d) files 

A data(.d) file represents a details viewer of a record from the database. A data file has 2 columns:  
-> first column contains the unique number of all table fields of the record;  
-> second column contains the values for all table fields of the record.  
![data files 1](./images/data_files_1.png)
<br>

> [!Note]
> Assuming that your **date-code** module is toggled to TAFJ project nature, make sure you update the .properties file related to your project from Your_DEV_Path/TAFJ/conf folder with the private database IP of your sandbox.

Before starting to extract/load data files from/to your sandbox database, you must login to TAFJ-DBTools.  
-> Right click on your **data-code** module and select **DBTools login**.
![extract data dbtools 1](./images/extract_data_dbtools_1.png)  
<br>
