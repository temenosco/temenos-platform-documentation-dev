# Environment Basic Operations

After logging to the portal and creating an environment, there are several actions (operations) that can be done via the available buttons: start, stop, rebuild, delete, scale up/ scale down, export and also boost and deploy the repository.

> <span style="color:RED">As a good practice and in terms of reducing your costs, it is recommended that you don't keep an environment **unused** for more than 3 days (for internal clients), respectively for more than 7 days (for external clients). Otherwise, the environment will be deleted by the Extend team (with a previous mail notification).
> 
> Also to reduce costs, the environment can be put on **Stop**.</span>
