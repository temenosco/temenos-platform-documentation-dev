# Introduction #
This document can be used by technical staff who need to create Users on the Temenos Cloud Platfrom and associate to each user a ssh key. 

## **Users**

----------

The Administrator can navigate to the Users section on the portal, create more users and invite them to access and use the portal using the URL link. This way the administrator is in control of who receives the URL link and which users can access the Organisation.

The users can access their organisation only, view their user profiles and change their password. Should the users requires access to the source code repository they need to provide their public SSH Keys on the user profile section to gain access.


# Use PuTTY ssh client for ssh key generation. #

You can use any other ssh key generator client.

> [!Note]
> If you already have installed a ssh key generator client, you can skip this step.

•	Download the installer from [http://www.putty.org/](http://www.putty.org/ "http://www.putty.org/")

•	Run the installer and click **Next** on each screen, without changing anything in configurations. Click **Finish** once completed.

# Create SSH keys (pair public and private keys) #

•	Open PuTTYgen and click Generate button:

•	After Puttygen finished key generation, you can save your public key/private key in any location from your local machine.

> [!Note]
> In order to have a valid ssh key that can be recognized by 
>  Infrastructure, do not use the Save public key button from Puttygen and just select the whole public key from the PuTTYgen screen and save it in your local machine.
